<h3>As a designer I believe in making intuitive and accesible designs. Iâ€™m a storyteller first weaving in the needs of the user and business. <strong>My specialty is bringing different teams to work together.</strong></h3>
<p>I grew up in Vancouver, Montreal, and Toronto and I am currently based in NYC. My path into design began like many others - on Neopets! This was where I started to learn to design and code by creating shop fronts for other players.</p>

<p>Drawing from my background in cognitive and computer sciences, I bring a research-driven perspective into my projects and can easily communicate and collaborate with developers and stakeholders across teams. I am always curious about why people make the decisions they do, and I find it exciting to design functional, accessible solutions that is <strong>scaled for a large number of people, externally and also internally.</strong></p>
<p>When I am not designing you may find me taking street photos, making crooked pots, or finding the next plant to add to my home.</p>
<p>I also watch a lot of movies and tv and have a collection of <a href="https://www.are.na/anna-nguyen-0rkqu6uzk-q/user-interfaces-in-film-and-tv">UI stills</a> I find inspiring.</p>
