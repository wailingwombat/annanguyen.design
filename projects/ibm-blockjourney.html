<p><strong>Overview</strong>: I worked on creating a standardized way to evaluate user journeys for all IBM.com products.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: UX Designer. Collaborated with product team. Consulted with senior designers.</p>
<p><strong>Impact Overview</strong>: Designing a system to evaluate IBM products</p>
<ul>
<li>My team was tasked with creating a consistent and great experience for users on IBM.com across 40 million pages owned by various teams across the world</li>
<li>During the project I collaborated with multiple design teams to create a <strong>standardized way show the user experience health</strong> of IBM digital products to product teams</li>
<li>For the pilot, I worked with the Blockchain product team and was able to <strong>reduce the fragmentation</strong> between their digital spaces ‚Äì website, in-product, and  emails. This evaluation allowed the team to think of the entire product journey and resulted in an <strong>increase page views and engagement</strong>.</li>
<li>The program that we started is now a formalized set of tools and process any designer at IBM can access</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Due to most of my work being internal, I can't show a lot of the work on my site. As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work with multiple teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.</p>
