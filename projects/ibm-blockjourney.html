<p><strong>Overview</strong>: I focused on establishing a standardized approach to evaluate user journeys for all IBM.com products.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: A UX Designer working with multiple senior designers, we collaborated with product teams across IBM.</p>
<p><strong>Impact Overview</strong>: Designing a system to evaluate IBM products</p>
<ul>
<li>The team was tasked with the effort to create a consistent and exceptional user experience for IBM.com across 40 million pages managed by diverse global teams.</li>
<li>Collaborated with multiple design teams to establish a standardized method for <strong>showcasing the user experience health</strong> of IBM digital products to product teams.</li>
<li>As the lead for the pilot to test our metrics health site. I collaborated with the Blockchain product team and was able to reduce fragmentation between their digital spaces ‚Äì website, in-product, and emails. This evaluation allowed the team to think of the entire product journey and resulted in <strong>increased page views and engagement</strong>.</li>
<li>The program initiated has evolved into a formalized set of tools and processes accessible to any designer at IBM.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I do at IBM: As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work collaboratively across teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.</p>
