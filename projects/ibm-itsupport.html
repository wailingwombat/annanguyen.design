<p><strong>Overview</strong>: I created a Slack tool that answered commonly asked IT questions.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Lead UX Designer and Researcher</p>
<p><strong>Impact Overview</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully helped employees find solutions to their problems and <strong>spend less time searching for information</strong>. Also fills a gap when a co-worker or support is not online like at night time.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce number of tickets</strong> for simple IT problems. Success was measured through data and user research.</li>
<li>Translated help documents into conversation flow. Optimized formatting handoff to content writer and developer by setting up a Slack Block Kit repo.</li>
<li>Guided the PO and team and scoped out the chatbot corpus and feature requirements through workshops.</li>
<li>Created a standard for chatbots on Slack in Figma. Created a standard personality and voice in addition to formatting standards in Slack Block Kit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Due to most of my work being internal, I can't show a lot of the work on my site. As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work with multiple teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.</p>
