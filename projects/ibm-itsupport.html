<p><strong>Overview</strong>: I led the design and research efforts for a Slack tool addressing common IT queries.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: As the Lead UX Designer and Researcher, I created a solution that effectively guided employees to IT solutions, reducing search times and ticket submissions, especially during non-office hours.</p>
<p><strong>Impact Overview</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significantly reduced tickets for basic IT issues</strong>, backed by measurable data and user research.</li>
<li>Translated help documents into conversational flows, streamlining handoffs to content writers and developers through a Slack Block Kit repo.</li>
<li>Guided the Product Owner and the team in scoping the chatbot corpus and feature requirements via workshops.</li>
<li>Established standards for Slack chatbots in Figma, defining personality, voice, and formatting guidelines in Slack Block Kit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Given the internal nature of my work at IBM's CIO Design team, I'm unable to showcase extensive details on my site. Reach out for PDF version.</p>
<p>What I do at IBM: As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work collaboratively across teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.</p>
