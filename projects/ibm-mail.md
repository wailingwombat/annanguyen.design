**Overview**: I initiated the pilot to transition internal employees to a new mail client

**Role**: UX Designer and Researcher with one other designer

**Impact Overview**:
- Email is an essential tool for employees. The old client was slow and no longer conformed to modern UX standards (it was Lotus Notes).
- Conducted a survey among a sample of the IBM population to understand their preferences for mail migration.
- Launched the pilot phase of a multi-year project aimed at migrating over 500,000 IBM employees from one mail client to another.
- Established a comprehensive communication strategy, including emails, tutorials, and a before-and-after migration experience for employees setting up their computers and phones.
- Incrementally improved the user experience through rounds of interviews and long-term metric gathering.
- Journey mapped the entire user experience to facilitate team collaboration and ensure a seamless transition for employees during migration.
