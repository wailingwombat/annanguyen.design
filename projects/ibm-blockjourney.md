**Overview**: I focused on establishing a standardized approach to evaluate user journeys for all IBM.com products.

**Role**: A UX Designer working with multiple senior designers, we collaborated with product teams across IBM.

**Impact Overview**: Designing a system to evaluate IBM products
- The team was tasked with the effort to create a consistent and exceptional user experience for IBM.com across 40 million pages managed by diverse global teams.
- Collaborated with multiple design teams to establish a standardized method for **showcasing the user experience health** of IBM digital products to product teams.
- As the lead for the pilot to test our metrics health site. I collaborated with the Blockchain product team and was able to reduce fragmentation between their digital spaces ‚Äì website, in-product, and emails. This evaluation allowed the team to think of the entire product journey and resulted in **increased page views and engagement**.
- The program initiated has evolved into a formalized set of tools and processes accessible to any designer at IBM.

Note: Given the internal nature of my work at IBM's CIO Design team, I'm unable to showcase extensive details on my site. Reach out for PDF version.

What I do at IBM: As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work collaboratively across teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.
