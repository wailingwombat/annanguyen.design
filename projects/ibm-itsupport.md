**Overview**: I led the design and research efforts for a Slack tool addressing common IT queries.

**Role**: As the Lead UX Designer and Researcher, I created a solution that effectively guided employees to IT solutions, reducing search times and ticket submissions, especially during non-office hours.

**Impact Overview**:
- **Significantly reduced tickets for basic IT issues**, backed by measurable data and user research.
- Translated help documents into conversational flows, streamlining handoffs to content writers and developers through a Slack Block Kit repo.
- Guided the Product Owner and the team in scoping the chatbot corpus and feature requirements via workshops.
- Established standards for Slack chatbots in Figma, defining personality, voice, and formatting guidelines in Slack Block Kit.
