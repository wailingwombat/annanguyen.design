**Overview**: I created a Slack tool that answered commonly asked IT questions.

**Role**: Lead UX Designer and Researcher

**Impact Overview**:
- Successfully helped employees find solutions to their problems and **spend less time searching for information**. Also fills a gap when a co-worker or support is not online like at night time.
- **Reduce number of tickets** for simple IT problems. Success was measured through data and user research.
- Translated help documents into conversation flow. Optimized formatting handoff to content writer and developer by setting up a Slack Block Kit repo.
- Guided the PO and team and scoped out the chatbot corpus and feature requirements through workshops.
- Created a standard for chatbots on Slack in Figma. Created a standard personality and voice in addition to formatting standards in Slack Block Kit.

Note: Due to most of my work being internal, I can't show a lot of the work on my site. As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work with multiple teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.
