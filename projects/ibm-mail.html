<p><strong>Overview</strong>: I worked on moving internal employees over to a new mail client.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: UX Designer and Researcher with one other designer</p>
<p><strong>Impact Overview</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email is an essential tool for employees. The old client was slow and no longer conformed to modern UX standards (it was Lotus Notes).</li>
<li>Survey a sample of IBM population on what their preference of mail migration was</li>
<li>Launched the pilot of a multi-year project to <strong>migrate all 500,000+ IBM employee</strong> from one mail client to another</li>
<li>Established the series of emails, tutorials, and before and after migration experience when employees set up their computer and phones for the first time</li>
<li>Incrementally <strong>improved user experience</strong> with rounds of interviews and long term metric gathering</li>
<li>Journey mapped the entire experience for the user to connect teams and ensure there was no gaps during an employee migration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Due to most of my work being internal, I can't show a lot of the work on my site. As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work with multiple teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.</p>
