<p><strong>Overview</strong>: I initiated the pilot to transition internal employees to a new mail client</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: UX Designer and Researcher with one other designer</p>
<p><strong>Impact Overview</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email is an essential tool for employees. The old client was slow and no longer conformed to modern UX standards (it was Lotus Notes).</li>
<li>Conducted a survey among a sample of the IBM population to understand their preferences for mail migration.</li>
<li>Launched the pilot phase of a multi-year project aimed at migrating over 500,000 IBM employees from one mail client to another.</li>
<li>Established a comprehensive communication strategy, including emails, tutorials, and a before-and-after migration experience for employees setting up their computers and phones.</li>
<li>Incrementally improved the user experience through rounds of interviews and long-term metric gathering.</li>
<li>Journey mapped the entire user experience to facilitate team collaboration and ensure a seamless transition for employees during migration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Given the internal nature of my work at IBM's CIO Design team, I'm unable to showcase extensive details on my site. Reach out for PDF version.</p>
<p>What I do at IBM: As part of IBM's CIO Design team, I work collaboratively across teams to improve our internal products. From legacy tools to new initiatives, I have guided design workshops and conducted user research making internal products more effective and user-friendly.</p>
